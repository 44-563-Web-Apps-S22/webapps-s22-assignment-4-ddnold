        <h2>The Miser</h2>
        <h4>
            This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,
            Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other
            authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.
            The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all
            natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,
            but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and
            renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those
            of his predecessors.

            that the borrower is of age and of a family whose property is ample,
            solid, secure, and free from all incumbrances, there shall be drawn up
            a good and correct bond before as honest a notary as it is possible to
            find, and who for this purpose shall be chosen by the lender, because
            he is the more concerned of the two that the bond should be rightly
            executed."

            first borrower shall pay this interest, without detriment to the rest;
