        <h2>The Miser</h2>
        <h4>This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,
            Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other
            authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.
            The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all
            natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,
            but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and
            renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those
            of his predecessors.</h4>

            LA FL. Well, here are some of the conditions which he has himself
            dictated to our go-between for you to take cognisance of, before
            anything is begun.
            
            "Supposing that the lender is satisfied with all his securities, and
            that the borrower is of age and of a family whose property is ample,
            solid, secure, and free from all incumbrances, there shall be drawn up
            a good and correct bond before as honest a notary as it is possible to
            find, and who for this purpose shall be chosen by the lender, because
            he is the more concerned of the two that the bond should be rightly
            executed."
            
            CLE. There is nothing to say against that.
            
            LA FL. "The lender, not to burden his conscience with the least
            scruple, does not wish to lend his money at more than five and a half
            per cent."
            
            CLE. Five and a half per cent? By Jove, that's honest! We have nothing
            to complain of.
            
            LA FL. That's true.
            
            "But as the said lender has not in hand the sum required, and as, in
            order to oblige the borrower, he is himself obliged to borrow from
            another at the rate of twenty per cent., it is but right that the said
            first borrower shall pay this interest, without detriment to the rest;
            since it is only to oblige him that the said lender is himself forced
            to borrow."
            
            CLE. The deuce! What a Jew! what a Turk we have here! That is more
            than twenty-five per cent.
            
            LA FL. That's true; and it is the remark I made. It is for you to
            consider the matter before you act.
            
            CLE. How can I consider? I want the money, and I must therefore accept
            everything.</pre>
